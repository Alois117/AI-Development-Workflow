# 🧠 AI Development Workflow – Patient Readmission Prediction

This project is part of the **AI for Software Engineering** course and demonstrates the complete AI development workflow using a **healthcare case study**: predicting whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The aim is to build and evaluate an AI system based on structured medical data, focusing on responsible development, evaluation, deployment, and ethical considerations.

## 🚀 Workflow Stages Covered

| Stage                   | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Problem Definition** | Defined the business problem, objectives, stakeholders, and success KPI.     |
| **2. Data Strategy**      | Proposed data sources, preprocessing steps, and bias mitigation.            |
| **3. Model Development**  | Selected a classification model, trained and tuned using real-world logic. |
| **4. Evaluation**         | Evaluated using precision, recall, and confusion matrix.                   |
| **5. Deployment**         | Built a mock Flask API for prediction.                                     |
| **6. Monitoring**         | Included drift detection strategy and model update plan.                   |
| **7. Reflection**         | Critical analysis of ethical risks and workflow challenges.                |
